**Philosophy of this application**

Please note the following before suggesting an idea:

This application only uses official APIs provided by Nextcloud.

It works as described below (fresh arrival on page):

1. User arrives on the application page
2. Page fetches list of provider of the Nextcloud instance
3. User types a search query
4. Page fetches the result of each provider for the given search query

If the URL contains predefined values, the step 3 is not necessary.

The application must not depend on other applications (except the core Nextcloud). This brings the following caveats

- not possible (yet) to fetch more information on results as the existing search API is quite light
- not possible to make specific behaviors for a given provider
